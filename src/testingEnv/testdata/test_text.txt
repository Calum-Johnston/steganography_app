To do:

'Program Structure.txt'
- Update project structure so it is known what to include in the program

Main Menu:
- Implement methods to get to GUI's from there
- Add some design to it (logo,background,etc)
- Implement main method that the program will run from

Encoding Menu:
- Remove main method from class
- Add drop down to select algorithm
- Inprove design
	- Spacing improvements
	- Add textures / background
- Add verification (i.e. to when we can encode, etc)

Decoding Menu:
- Setup decoding class (main method, constructor, etc)
- Implement decoding for LSBM
- Implement decoding for LSBMR
- Add drop down to select algorithm when decoding
- POTENTIAL: Automatically detect which algorithm
- Improve design:
	- Spacing improvements
	- More user friendly (textures, backgrouds, etc)
- Error checking, etc

PRNG:
- Develop method to randomly hide data in image based on seed 
- Seed must be provided by the user

Sources:
- Sort out sources document (between sources.txt and word document)
- Ensure to annonate correctly

'Dissertation Structure'
- Define all section headings / subsections and what to include in diss
- Relate each heading / sub-heading to sources in Sources.txt
- Confirm with Matthew

Text Documents:
- Make an LSB.txt to describe LSB
- Make an LSBM.txt to describe LSBM
- Make an LSBMR.txt to describe LSBMR
- Make a PRNG.txt to describe Pseudo Random Number Generator


Research more algorithms to implement
Improve sources:
- Remove unused sources
- Acquire more sources for paper writing (i.e ones that discuss history, etc)
- Acquire more sources on algorithms (even if not implemented) - for related work!
